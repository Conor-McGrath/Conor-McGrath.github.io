Hi, I'm Conor. I'm originally from suburban Philadelphia, but now call South Bend, IN home as I pursue my Master's in Business Analytics at Notre Dame. I'm also a UVA graduate of the McIntire School of Commerce. I have a passion for solving life's curiosities with data and on my page you'll find projects I've created spanning a variety of topics, especially sports, business, and culture. Additionally, you can read some of my blog posts to get an understanding of the insights I've gained working on a particular project. If you find any of these projects/posts interesting, feel free to reach out as I'd love to get the conversation rolling.
